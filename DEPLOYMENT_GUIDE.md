# 🚀 NPT Flutter App - GitHub Actions Only Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: No Local Builds Allowed**

As per project requirements, **ALL builds, tests, analysis, formatting, and deployments MUST run exclusively on GitHub Actions**. No local builds or tests are permitted.

## 📋 **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

### 1. **Repository Setup**
```bash
# Initialize git (if not done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit initial code
git commit -m "Initial NPT Flutter App Launcher implementation"

# Add GitHub remote (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/npt-launcher.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. **GitHub Repository Settings**

#### **Required Repository Secrets** (if needed for signing):
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE` (Base64 encoded keystore file)
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`

#### **Required Repository Permissions**:
- Enable **Actions** in repository settings
- Enable **Issues** for CI/CD feedback
- Enable **Discussions** for build notifications

## 🔄 **GitHub Actions Workflow Overview**

Our CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) includes:

### **1. Code Analysis Job** 🔍
- Flutter analyze with fatal warnings
- Dart formatting validation
- Configuration file validation (no trailing spaces, deprecated options)
- Gradle settings verification

### **2. Testing Job** 🧪
- Unit and widget tests
- Coverage reporting
- Coverage artifact upload (30-day retention)

### **3. Build Job** 🏗️
- **Build Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts with cleanup between retries
- Debug and Release APK builds
- APK size measurement and performance rating
- Artifact uploads with 30-day retention

### **4. Release Job** 🚀 (Main branch only)
- Automated release creation
- Release notes generation
- APK attachment to releases

## 📈 **Performance Ratings**

The CI automatically rates APK performance:
- **🌟 Excellent**: <10MB APK size
- **👍 Good**: <25MB APK size  
- **⚠️ Average**: <50MB APK size
- **🚨 Large**: >50MB APK size

## 🚦 **Deployment Process**

### **For Development (develop branch):**
1. Push code to `develop` branch
2. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Run code analysis
   - Execute all tests
   - Build debug APK
   - Generate coverage reports

### **For Production (main branch):**
1. Create Pull Request from `develop` to `main`
2. GitHub Actions runs full validation on PR
3. Merge PR to `main` branch
4. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Run full CI pipeline
   - Build release APK
   - Create GitHub release
   - Upload APK as release asset

## 🔧 **Build Configuration Details**

### **Gradle CI Optimization:**
```properties
# Configured for CI stability
org.gradle.daemon=false
org.gradle.parallel=false
org.gradle.configuration-cache=true
```

### **Android Configuration:**
- **Package**: `com.example.npt`
- **minSdkVersion**: 23 (Android 6.0+)
- **Permissions**: QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES, GET_PACKAGE_SIZE, INTERNET, WAKE_LOCK
- **ProGuard**: Enabled for release builds with optimization

### **Flutter Configuration:**
- **Version**: 3.24.0 stable
- **Dependencies**: All verified from pub.dev
- **State Management**: Provider pattern
- **Performance**: SliverGrid with optimizations

## 📊 **Monitoring Build Status**

### **Build Status Indicators:**
- ✅ **Success**: All checks passed, APK ready
- ❌ **Failed**: Check Actions tab for detailed logs
- 🔄 **In Progress**: Build currently running
- ⏸️ **Pending**: Waiting for previous jobs

### **Accessing Build Artifacts:**
1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub repository
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Scroll down to **Artifacts** section
4. Download APK files (valid for 30 days)

### **Release Downloads:**
1. Go to **Releases** section in GitHub repository
2. Download APK from latest release
3. Install on Android device (enable "Install from unknown sources")

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting CI/CD Issues**

### **Common Build Failures:**

#### **1. Dependency Issues**
```
Error: Package not found
```
**Solution**: GitHub Actions will automatically retry with `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

#### **2. Gradle Build Failures**
```
Error: Gradle build failed
```
**Solution**: CI includes 3-attempt retry logic with cleanup between attempts

#### **3. Analysis Failures**
```
Error: flutter analyze found issues
```
**Solution**: Check the analysis job logs for specific issues to fix

#### **4. Test Failures**
```
Error: Tests failed
```
**Solution**: Review test job logs for specific test failures

### **Viewing Detailed Logs:**
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on failed workflow
3. Click on failed job
4. Expand log sections to see detailed error messages

## 🔒 **Security & Best Practices**

### **Code Quality Enforcement:**
- All code must pass `flutter analyze` with no warnings
- All code must be properly formatted (`dart format`)
- No trailing spaces in configuration files
- No deprecated JVM options in Gradle files

### **Artifact Management:**
- Build artifacts retained for 30 days
- Coverage reports uploaded for tracking
- Build logs available for debugging

### **Release Security:**
- Automated releases only on main branch
- Release notes auto-generated with build metrics
- APK signing handled by GitHub Actions (if configured)

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

### **Build Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All analysis checks pass
- ✅ All tests pass with good coverage
- ✅ APK builds successfully
- ✅ APK size within acceptable limits
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities

### **Expected Build Times:**
- **Analysis**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Testing**: ~3-5 minutes
- **Building**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Total**: ~10-18 minutes

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Deployment**

1. **Monitor first build** in GitHub Actions
2. **Check build artifacts** are generated correctly
3. **Test APK download** from releases
4. **Install and test** on real Android device
5. **Set up branch protection rules** for main branch
6. **Configure notifications** for build failures
